## Xiaomi's Game Changing Camera Lenses

Xiaomi has announced the launch of  its flagship series globally. 
Released in China last year, the Xiaomi 13 Series has a lot in store for us. With a Leica lens camera, Xiaomi plans to smoothen the transition from a professional camera to a smartphone. 
A triple camera at the back that includes a 50-megapixel OIS sensor, a 10-megapixel telephoto lens provided by Leica, and a 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor, the Xiaomi 13 model is something that everyone is looking forward to. A 4500mAh battery with 67W fast charging and 50W wireless charging adds to the list.

The high-end Xiaomi 13 Pro has improved camera specs like a 50-megapixel 1-inch sensor, a 50-megapixel telephoto Leica lens, and another 50-megapixel ultrawide sensor. In terms of charging capabilities, a 4820mAh battery  with 120W wired charging, 50W wireless charging, and 10W reverse wireless charging allows for efficient charging options. Advanced features like 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth v5.3, and NFC are like the cherry on the top. 

## Pushing Financial Boundaries with Cross Country Linkages

Covid 19 has pushed Indian users to online money transfer and UPI has emerged as India's favorite online transaction method. After a long wait, India and Singapore have linked their payment systems UPI and Paynow. This enables instant and low-cost fund transfers in a major push to disrupt the cross-border flow of money between the two nations (which amounts to more than $1 billion each year). Citizens in each nation can use their local payments system to send money to those in the other country in “real-time.”

“The PayNow-UPI linkage is India’s first cross-border, real-time system linkage and Singapore’s second. It’s also the world’s first such linkage featuring cloud-based infrastructure and participation by non-bank financial institutions,” said Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
